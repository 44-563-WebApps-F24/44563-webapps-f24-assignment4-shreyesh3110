        <h1>Shreyesh Chennagouni presents a Greek play by Sophocles</h1>
        <h3>OEDIPUS AT COLONOS - SOPHOCLES</h3>

            <h4>CR.</h4> 
            <p>Which of us twain, believ’st thou, in this talk
            Hath more profoundly sinned against thy peace?</p>

            <h4>OED.</h4>
            <p>If thou prevail’st with these men present here
            Even as with me, I shall be well content.</p>    

            <h4>CR. </h4>
            <p>_tone becomes more pitying_</p>
            <p>Unhappy man, will not even Time bring forth
            One spark of wisdom to redeem thine age?</p>

            <h4>OED.</h4> 
            <p>Thou art a clever talker. But I know
                No just man who in every cause abounds
                With eloquent speech.</p>

            <h4>CR.</h4> 
            <p>’Tis not to abound in speech,
                When one speaks fitting words in season.</p>

            <h4>OED.</h4>
            <p>_interrupts_</p> 
            <p>Oh! As if thy words were few and seasonable!</p>

            <h4>CR.</h4> 
            <p>Not in the dotard’s judgement.</p>
