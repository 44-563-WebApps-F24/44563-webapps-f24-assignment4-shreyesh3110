        <h1>Shreyesh Chennagouni presents a Greek play by Sophocles</h1>
        <h3>OEDIPUS AT COLONOS - SOPHOCLES</h3>

            <p><b>CR.</b> Which of us twain, believ’st thou, in this talk
            Hath more profoundly sinned against thy peace?</p>

            <p><b>OED.</b> If thou prevail’st with these men present here
            Even as with me, I shall be well content.</p>    

            <p><b>CR. </b> Unhappy man, will not even Time bring forth
            One spark of wisdom to redeem thine age?</p>

            <p><b>OED.</b> Thou art a clever talker. But I know
                No just man who in every cause abounds
                With eloquent speech.</p>

            <p><b>CR.</b> ’Tis not to abound in speech,
                When one speaks fitting words in season.</p>

            <p><b>OED.</b> Oh!
                As if thy words were few and seasonable!</p>

            <p><b>CR.</b> Not in the dotard’s judgement.</p>
